I've started learning HTML and this is the basic structure of a web page.

{% highlight html %}
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>This goes in the browser tab title</title>
</head>
<body>
This is where the visible parts of the web page go.

</body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

# head

This is where scripts, styles and information about the web page goes.

# title

This is in the head tag and it is really important for Google and Bing search engines.

# body

This is where all the text, images, videos, audio goes, basically the bits we see and hear on a website.
